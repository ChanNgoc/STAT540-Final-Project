# STAT540-Final-Project

This project starts with two sets of data from the Mississippi traffic stops and the other about county populations by race.  

The goal of this project is to perform data wrangling methods on the data sets, such as group by certain variables, filter and select specific data values. Using these techniques, we can observe if certain variables have higher rates or correlations to others, or if there are outliers and what results in that.  

The motivation for this project is to create simpler ways to observe the data, so we can learn more about traffic stops. And the many variables that could affect traffic in the state of Mississippi.
